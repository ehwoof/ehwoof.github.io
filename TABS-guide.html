         <p>TABS (Totally Accurate Battle Simulator) is a parody battle simulator. Play singleplayer to make custom battles, campaign for a challenge, or multiplayer for a battle with an organizer on both sides! Custom content can also be created, and has a built in way to access mods!</p>
         <p>TABG (Totally Accurate BattleGrounds) is a parody battle royale game. It is similar to TABS, except you have one unit that you control, and you find weapons scattered around a single, massive map, which you get onto by jumping off a flying semitrailer and skydiving to your preferred location. Weapons include guns (some with lasers, rockets, tasers, water, and even a Joker referance), crossbows (some with bombs, ballons, fireworks, and tasers), melee (axes and swords galore, oh and that ballistic sheild over there), magic books (too many to list), grenades (orbital strike is not to be used lightly), and blessings (POWER.) </p>
