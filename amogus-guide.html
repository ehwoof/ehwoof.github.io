         <p>Among Us, popularly known as Amogus, is a game where you get a role and then do your job, except more interesting with lots and lots of murder!</p>
         <p>Crewmate-Frantically hold the spaceship/skyscraper/base/blimp-thingy together as you try to figure who's murdering you all! Fun!</p>
         <p>Imposter-Frantically try to murder Crewmates and destroy their spaceship/skyscraper/base/blimp-thingy! Don't let people see you use the vents.</p>
         <p>Ghost-Still try to hold the thingy (I'm not writing that again) together, but you don't get to tell people who killed you. Unless you use Discord.</p>
         <p>Engineer-A Crewmate who uses vents. If people see you venting, they will throw you into deep space, "just to be safe." (They're not safe. There's an Imposter.)</p>
         <p>Scientist-Look at your tablet to see who's dead. Recharge it by holding the thingy together.</p>
         <p>Shapeshifter-You're an Imposter, but you can turn into other people.</p>
         <p>Guardian Angel-A Ghost that can protect people from being brutally murdered. Still hold the thingy together.</p>
