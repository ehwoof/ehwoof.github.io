         <p>Minecraft Java Edition is a game that can be played in many different ways.</p>
         <p>Creative Mode-Fly around by double-jumping. Break blocks (which make up the world) in one hit. Access most or all of the items and blocks in the game through the creative inventory and commands.</p>
         <p>Survival Mode-Attempt to survive! Start by punching a tree to get wood, then use it to craft and mine other materials. Loot structures, fight monsters, and collect food! Finally, defeat the Ender Dragon and then do whatever you want! (Including spawn another, worse boss, the wither. But why would you do that?)</p>
         <p>Hardcore-Survival, but more realistic in that if you die you're dead. Also doors don't keep zombies out. Sleep peacefully!</p>
